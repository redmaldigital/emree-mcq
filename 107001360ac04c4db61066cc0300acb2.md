People's opinion about the exam:

-   Person 1:

    -   About at least 50% were repeated, mainly from Road to emree and
        > last year's papers, almost all amboss questions of last year
        > came. All topics were almost equally covered, with nthew
        > questions seen more inIVF psychiatry, biostats, and Ob Gyne.
        > ⁹ul677i

    -   Reading the comments on road to emree file and even in 294
        > document helped in answering several of the new questions, so
        > don't skip the comments. Good luck

-   Person 2:

    -   The exam did have a few repeats - maybe around 40-50 qs, but
        > most of us felt like the repeat were only few. 294 did not
        > really come in the exam. The qs in general focussed and next
        > step of management in terms of getting scans or imaging done.

-   Person 3:

    -   3 hours were barely enough to solve the questions. Yeah, there
        > were lots of new questions, the majority of the exam, imo, had
        > new questions.

    -   Tip: make sure to revise last year's questions and double check
        > the answers there.
