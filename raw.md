People's opinion about the exam:

-   Person 1:

    -   About at least 50% were repeated, mainly from Road to emree and
        > last year's papers, almost all amboss questions of last year
        > came. All topics were almost equally covered, with nthew
        > questions seen more inIVF psychiatry, biostats, and Ob Gyne.
        > ⁹ul677i

    -   Reading the comments on road to emree file and even in 294
        > document helped in answering several of the new questions, so
        > don't skip the comments. Good luck

-   Person 2:

    -   The exam did have a few repeats - maybe around 40-50 qs, but
        > most of us felt like the repeat were only few. 294 did not
        > really come in the exam. The qs in general focussed and next
        > step of management in terms of getting scans or imaging done.

-   Person 3:

    -   3 hours were barely enough to solve the questions. Yeah, there
        > were lots of new questions, the majority of the exam, imo, had
        > new questions.

    -   Tip: make sure to revise last year's questions and double check
        > the answers there.

A patient had BNP 500 smth, it was asking which drug would reduce
mortality (or smth like longest term This patient has HF with reduced
ejection fraction EF was 35%, the question was asking about which drug
is associated with reduced mortality:

-Digoxin.

-Furosemide.

-Amlodipine

-The 4th option has 2 drugs: Valsartan/Scauitril (ARB + Nepritysin
inhibitor) together, one is ARBs and the other one i don\'t remember but
it WasNOT ACEI

benefit)? Choices were furosemide, digoxin, ACEi+ARB(I think this is
correct)There is no such thing as ACEi + ARB, I think you mean ARNI
(angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor) which is the correct answer.

A male patient came with symptoms of appendicitis(for a long time i
think a week) I lthink from their explanation of the imaging it was
already ruptured because they said it had fluid around it. What should
be done?

a.  Appendectomy in a few days with immediate antibiotics

b.  Percutaneous aspiration and IV antibiotics.

This Q was about complicated appendicitis ,5cm appendicular abscess,
what is the next step: \[the patient was feverish with abdominal
tenderness\].

-IV antibiotics, and imaging guided percutaneous drainage.

-Oral antibiotics and imaging guided percutaneous drainage.

-other options was about immediate surgical removal.

Patient present with bleeding, he is hypotensive (80/60), best initial
step?

a.  IV fluid

b.  Blood and cross match =

c.  Endoscopy

Patient with active hematemesis, he was alert but hemodynamically
unstable BP 70/50\[ he was in hemorrhagic shock, they mentioned in the
stem that his lower limbs are cold and dry\]: what is the next step:

(Always stabilize first and then go for other investigations)

**-2 liters of crystalloids over** 20**-30 mins.**

-Cross match and packed blood transfusion.\*

-Sengstaken--Blakemore ballon tamponade.

-Upper endoscopy.

Child i think 10 months old, did not have pre/postnatal care, was born
in a refugee camp, had bleeding, no petechia or purpura, how would the
labs be? Labs were between platelets, PT, aPTT. The choices were mixed
between increased/decreased/normal. I think it is vitamin K deficiency
because he didn\'t receive vitamin K shot. (Labs in Vit k deficiency:
prolonged PT/INR, normal platelets, ppssiblby prolonged aPTT) So I chose
normal platelets, normal aPTT, abnormal PT
